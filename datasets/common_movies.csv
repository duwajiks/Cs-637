LA LA Land is the story of relentless Mikey Forearms, and his partner in stupidity Johnny, as they chase the dream and stumble their way through Hollywood's back doors. Armed with confidence if not talent, Mikey is anxious to get his career underway. Mikey unleashes himself on casting directors, but none of them appreciate his ""acting chops"". In the pilot episode he is offered a job that is not exactly what he had in mind. Following Johnny's suggestion, he meets Super Agent Jerry Flaxman and Big Shot Producer Alan Gilstein. Flaxman and Gilstein think they've found the perfect pawn for their game, but maybe Mikey is not as dumb as he looks. Can he get his lucky break in LA LA Land?",0.613,/nmdBXLTDzTaWzxcY32vz8CSpzbQ.jpg,,Comedy,,,,

Sirota) is a sweeping romantic musical about the human need for love and companionship, based on Mary Shelley’s classic novel.  Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was first published in 1818, and this work honors that source material as a contemporary work of musical theatre.  Having lost his mother at a young age, Victor Frankenstein seeks to end human mortality and arrogantly enters territory beyond his control. While he enjoys unconditional love from Elizabeth, he grants none to his creation.  The Off-Broadway production of Sirota’s FRANKENSTEIN opened in 2017 and ran for nearly 3 years in the NYC theatre district at St. Luke’s Theatre, where it achieved acclaim.

Through intricate movements and intimate contact, they explore the depths of their discord, creating a visually stunning and emotionally charged performance.
